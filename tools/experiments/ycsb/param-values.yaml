# The multi-region transactions are spread over the number of regions following the 80/20 rule.
# Precisely, their weights are generated under the generalized zipfian distribution with a = 2.7,
# using the following Python code.
# ```
# import numpy as np
# from scipy.special import zeta
# k = np.arange(1, 3)
# a = 2.6
# z = k**-a/zeta(a)
# (z/sum(z) * scale).astype(int) # scale is the percentage of multi-region transactions times 1000
# ```
