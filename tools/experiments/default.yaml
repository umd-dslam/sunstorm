# Information about the parameter keys. The order specified here will be the order in which

# Each parameter is a list of values, which will be combined in all possible ways. A value
# can either be a literal value or an object with a "name" and "value" field. The latter way
# of specifying the value should be used if the value is too long because all values will be
# used in the name of the result. All parameters here must appear in "param_keys".

# A list of rules to replace the values in a parameter combination. Every combination generated
# from "parameters" will be passed through these rules. The rules are applied in the order they
# are listed here. Each rule has two parts: a "match" and a "set". The "match" part specifies
# a list of conditions and a combination only need to match with at least one condition.
# The "set" part specifies the values that will be set if the combination matches.
